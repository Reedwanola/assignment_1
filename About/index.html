    <h2>About me:</h2>

    <h2>Why AltSchool?</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Growing up, I've always been fascinated by the capabilities of technology without even knowing it was called 'tech.' When I started this program, I knew nothing about the tech industry because I was a total newbie. I chose ALT School over others because my interest isn't just to become a successful software engineer, but also to have a smooth onboarding into the tech industry at large. I identified ALT School as the perfect vehicle to put me in that direction. It's been over a month into this program, and I believe I made the right decision in choosing ALT School.</p>

Networking within the tech community is a priority, aiming to establish connections through conferences, forums, and collaborative initiatives. Cultivating a problem-solving mindset, fostering an entrepreneurial spirit, and actively contributing to the tech community are integral aspects of my journey. I plan to set clear career milestones, aligning with my long-term aspirations and staying committed to continuous learning.
